# Log Message Classification System

A powerful hybrid log classification pipeline using regex, BERT-based embeddings, and LLM fallback — built for production log intelligence.

---

##  Features

-  Rule-based classification with regex
-  ML-based classification using Sentence-BERT + Logistic Regression
-  LLM fallback for hard-to-classify legacy logs (Groq + LLaMA3)
-  Clustering & Visualization with UMAP
-  Modular pipeline (easy to extend and integrate into APIs or batch systems)
-  FastAPI endpoint for real-time log file classification

---

##  Installation

Ensure Python 3.9 or higher is installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SteveParadox/Logify-A-Smart-Server-Log-Classification-Microservice.git
cd log-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file with your Groq API key:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key_here
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage

###  Classify Logs from CSV

```bash
python classify.py
```

This reads `resources/test.csv` and writes the classified logs to `resources/output.csv`.

### 📡 Classify via FastAPI

Run the API:

```bash
uvicorn server:app --reload
```

Send a POST request to:

```
POST /classify/
```

With form-data including a `.csv` file having the columns: `source` and `log_message`.

### 📜 Example CSV Format

```csv
source,log_message
LegacyCRM,System reboot initiated by user Admin
ModernApp,User User12 logged in.
```
